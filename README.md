# GOOGL-LSTM-Analysis
Using neural networks to predict stock prices! <br/>
Using LSTM neural networks for predicting stock prices is pretty much the industry standard, so I decided to give it a shot :)

# My Next Steps
I want to start standardizing my data: <br/>
I'm currently using the initial 'Closing Cost' price, but when it varies by a lot my model becomes extremely unaccurate <br/><br/>
I want to start incorporating more validation sets into my models: <br/>
It's good practice so I need to get in the habit of doing it more
